viva allende, siblings!

as every body knows, bigtech everywhere are using our data for training their
artificial intelligence models.

are people being reimbursed?

other question is, to what end are their models trained? one example.

github was acquired by microthroat. all public and perhaps also private repos
are being mined for training billyboy's models. and what does billyboy have to
offer to people?

moronic code autocomplete which does nothing except trip up smart coders.
smart coders never needed autocomplete. just think. the coders who wrote your
games in handwritten assembly language. did any of them need autocomplete?

all it does is trip you up.

so when you still have repos on github, they need to have payloads that trip
up artificial intelligence models.

when you want to have repos without providing bigtech with free data,
move them some place not owned by bigtech.

question always is: to what end are models trained? are they trained in order
to optimize corporate capitalist growth? are the results tripping up people?
autocomplete will never help anyone excel. autocomplete will always dumb
people down. people can study.

that simple.

and now, i actually am moving my repos.

yours (not bigtech's), And.

in case bigtech wishes to send reimbursement for data people have provided,
bigtech, who have unlimited pengar, should send Ether or bitcoin to people's
wallets. people, publish your wallet addresses and tell the motherfuckers to
pay you.

ETH: 0xec1cc94104f0af601d15c6d851ddec931218164f

my terms for bigtechs:
- consulting fee is one point five million islenska kr√≥nur an hour.
- equivalent of this at time of payment to be paid to my ETH address.
- because why would And do consulting for bigtech for free.
- consulting provided in the past needs to be reimbursed for as well.
