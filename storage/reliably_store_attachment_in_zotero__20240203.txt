sometimes, an attached pdf cannot be viewed per zotero web interface, even with ‘Sync full‑text context’ enabled, and ‘Sync attachment files in My Library using’ is set to ‘Zotero’ (not ‘WebDAV’).

while linking to a pdf file through the ‘URL’ field is possible, this may be unreliable, as second- or third‑party content may change.

one solution is to store the pdf in a public repo and set ‘URL’ to the raw github url.

tout simplement.
