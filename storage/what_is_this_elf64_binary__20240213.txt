Please understand this is not a challenge set up by myself or any one I know,
as I have grown sick and tired of this kind of challenge.

I have found something in my /usr/bin and can't tell what it is. It is a small
elf64 binary. I truly cannot be bothered to spend any time analyzing this now,
as I have better things to do.

So if there is someone with time on their hands, and wanting to have a peek,
sharing results with the public internet would be appreciated if it is
anything of interest. I simply don't know.

Find at the URI below a four kbyte small archive containing:
- the binary in question
- a short explanatory readme.txt
- checksums.yaml

https dot slash slash · and0uille dot net · /what-is-dot__sha256_is_5b42c4c20aa86b5bcd7ed7e7860240d8abd67f0e35d810c125de3a8fb778818e.tar.bz2

Obviously the sha256 in the file name is for the file itself.

But be careful. Challenges are distraction are death. So think twice before
actually investing your precious time.
