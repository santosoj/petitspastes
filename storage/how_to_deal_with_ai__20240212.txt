As we are increasingly surrounded by AI, it becomes necessary for minds to
grow protection against impairment caused by AI.

Impairment is distraction, being slowed down, being unable to focus,
being unable to study.

There are some measures which can be taken, refined, and evolved.

    - Steer clear of distractions.
    - Care needs to be taken not to provide capitalists with data for model
      training without receiving something valued in exchange.
    - It is not that complex to discern between good AI and bad AI.
      When the purpose is capitalist growth, AI is bad.
    - What world requires is degrowth. Saito is right.
    - What world requires is green surface.
    - What world requires is ice.
    - What world requires is silence.
    - There is too much chatter all around us.
    - Chatter needs to be healed by ice and silence.
    - Noise may be used against chatter.
    - Play brown noise to suppress chatter.
    - Chatter makes people stupid.
    - Chatter makes it impossible for people to do serious work.
    - Chatter makes it impossible for people to study.
    - Steer clear of distractions.
    - It is required to fuzz AI but in a way which does not make someone
      appear outwardly mentally ill.
